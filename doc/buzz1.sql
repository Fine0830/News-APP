She will now face Flavia Pennetta for the title.Vinci is currently ranked 43rd in the world and is a five-time Grand Slam champion in women’s doubles. She also has a career Grand Slam in doubles, which only five women’s pairs have achieved.

The other loss was against Kim Clijsters in the 2009 semifinals, when Clijsters went on to win the tournament.\r\nThis will be Vinci’s first appearance in a Grand Slam singles final.\r\nGoing into the semifinal match she had yet to face a seeded player.

Yeah, I won four in a row. It’s pretty good. Yeah, so it’s definitely the positive.”\r\nVinci called the victory “incredible,” and said it was “like a dream.” She acknowledged the American crowd’s interest in Williams, but said, “today is my day.
